<h2>Chinese Poker vs. Poker</h2>
<p>Chinese Poker is also called Big Two, derived from the literal Chinese translation of the game name. It shares some similarities and differences between Western Poker. For example, in Chinese Poker, the 2 is stronger than the Ace. Additionally, instead of players getting dealt two cards, the entire deck is split evenly between players. Some more comparisons between the two, as well as some additionally rules, can be found at this link:</p>

<h2>How to Play Chinese Poker</h2>
<p>Unlike Western Poker, the object of Chinese Poker is to be the first to get rid of all your cards. The deck is split evenly and each player gets the same amount of cards. It's typically up to house rules to decide who goes first, but usually the player with the 3 of Diamonds starts, as that is the weakest card.</p> 
<p>The starting player may play anything they want, so long as it is a legal move that contains the 3 of Diamonds. Players must play the same amount of cards as the person before them. For example, if the player before you played a triple, you must also play a triple or pass. If they played a 5-card combo, you must also play a 5-card combo (or pass).</p>
<p>Similar to Western Poker, individual card strength is based on the suit of the card, with diamonds being the weakest, then clubs, hearts, and spades being the strongest. Chinese Poker uses the same combos as Western Poker, with the exception of the two-pair. The combos are listed below from weakest to strongest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Straight - 5 cards in consecutive order</li>
<li>Flush - 5 cards of the same suit</li>
<li>Full House - A 2-of-a-kind combined with a 3-of-a-kind</li>
<li>Bomb - A 4-of-a-kind combined with any single card</li>
<li>Straight Flush - 5 cards of the same suit in consecutive order</li>
<li>Royal Flush - Same as the straight flush, but the cards must be 10, J, Q, K, A</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mandarin Poker</h2>
<p>There is a slightly different variation of Chinese Poker called Landlord. This variation includes slightly different combos and is generally played with 3 people, in which 2 "servants" team up against a "landlord". More rules can be found here:
