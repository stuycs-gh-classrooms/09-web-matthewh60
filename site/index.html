  <h1>Overview</h1>
    <h2>What is Mahjong?</h2>
    <p>
      Mahjong was invented in China during the 1800s. The name “mahjong” is a translation of the word “sparrow”, referring to the sound the tiles make during reshuffling. One could make a connection between mahjong and gin rummy in the sense that the objective in both games is to create sets of tiles/cards. Unlike gin rummy, however, mahjong uses much more tiles that are laid out on the table in a unique rectangular pattern. This website goes into more depth about the different mahjong tiles, as well as its worldwide influence, and of course, how to play!
