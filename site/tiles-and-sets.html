  <h1>Tiles and Sets</h1>
    <h2>Tiles</h2>
    <p>
      Mahjong has 34 unique tiles, with four of each tile making for a total of 136 tiles. There are optional bonus season tiles and flower tiles, which can make for a maximum of 144 tiles (there is only one of each bonus tile). The image below shows all the tiles in the game, including the bonus tiles.

    <p>The first three rows show the dot, bamboo, and character tiles, respectively. Notice how there are nine tiles each of these kind; these tiles are called suited, and can be used to make straights and three of a kinds.</p>
    <p>The fourth row consists of the wind tiles and dragon tiles on the left and right, respectively. These tiles can only be used to make three of a kinds.</p>
    <p>The last row consists of the bonus flower and season tiles.</p>
    <h2>Sets</h2>
    <p>Making sets is required in order to win a round of mahjong. There are only three kinds of sets you can make:</p>
    <h4>Pair</h4>
      <ul> <li>Have two of the same tile.</li>
           <li>May be done with any kind of tile.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Three of a Kind</h4>
      <ul> <li>Have three of the same tile.</li>
           <li>May be done with any kind of tile.</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Straight or Run</h4>
      <ul> <li>Must use suited tiles (dot, bamboo, character).</li>
           <li>Must be three of the same kind of tile such that their "numbers" are in consecutive order.</li>
           <li>You can determine the "number" of the tile by looking at how many items are in the tile. For example, if you count six items on the tile, it has a "number" of 6. The exceptions to this are the character tiles, in which the character written on the title translates to the "number" of the tile.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Below is an example of a pair, a three of a kind, and a straight.</p>
